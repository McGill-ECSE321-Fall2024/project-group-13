# E-Commerce Video Game Store

## Project Overview

This project is an e-commerce website designed to allow users to purchase video games. Users will be able to create accounts, manage wishlists and shopping carts, and securely input their payment and shipping information to complete purchases. The website will also feature user reviews for each game. Our team is responsible for building every aspect of the project, from the database layer to the websiteâ€™s user interface.

### Current Deliverable

The first part of the project centered on constructing the model diagram and database schema, and integrating them into the persistence layer, which will serve as the foundation for the website. Tests were also written to ensure everything is functioning as expected.
