# E-Commerce Video Game Store

## Project Overview

This project is an e-commerce website designed to allow users to purchase video games. Users will be able to create accounts, manage wishlists and shopping carts, and securely input their payment and shipping information to complete purchases. The website will also feature user reviews for each game. Our team is responsible for building every aspect of the project, from the database layer to the websiteâ€™s user interface.

### Current Deliverable

The second deliverable focuses on implementing backend services using Java Spring, evolving the persistence layer, and documenting RESTful endpoints. It includes a comprehensive software quality assurance plan, unit and integration testing, a build system for automation, and project management through GitHub issue tracking.
